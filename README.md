# 🌊 agt_sea

An AI-powered creative marketing tool for brands and agencies offering a number of services designed to improve creative output. 

The app is structured as a multipage Streamlit application with standalone modules for Strategy, Creative, and a full Workflow pipeline, plus a Tools page in development.

A Strategist writes the creative brief, a Creative generates ideas, and a Creative Director evaluates the work through a configurable creative philosophy. The system iterates until the work meets the quality threshold or the iteration budget is exhausted.

Built with LangGraph, LangChain, and Streamlit.

```

The graph is defined in `graph/workflow.py` using LangGraph's `StateGraph`. Two conditional edges implement the approval gate and iteration limit. Routing functions are pure (return strings only). State mutations happen in dedicated finalisation nodes before `END`.

### Agents

| Agent | File | Role | Output |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| **Strategist** | `agents/strategist.py` | Transforms the raw client brief into a focused creative brief | Challenge, audience, insight, proposition, tone |
| **Creative** (1.0) | `agents/creative.py` | Generates three distinct creative approaches per iteration | Concept title, core idea, execution, rationale |
| **Creative 1** (2.0) | `agents/creative1.py` | Generates *n* distinct creative territories from the brief (default 3, configurable 1–10 via `num_territories`). Optional `territory_rejection_context` steers a regenerated batch. | Structured `list[Territory]` — each with title, core idea, why it works |
| **Creative Director** | `agents/creative_director.py`| Evaluates creative work through a chosen philosophical lens | Structured score (0–100), strengths, weaknesses, direction |

The Creative agent has two prompt paths: initial generation (from brief only) and revision (incorporating CD feedback). It only sees the latest concept and latest feedback per iteration — not full history.

The Creative Director uses `with_structured_output(CDEvaluation)` to constrain LLM output to a validated Pydantic model.

All three agents build their system prompt via a module-level `_build_system_prompt(philosophy)` helper. When the philosophy is `NEUTRAL`, no philosophy section is injected and the prompt reads as if the feature wasn't there at all; otherwise the text is loaded from disk and injected into a dedicated section. The Strategist additionally assembles its prompt from a reusable creative-brief template and proposition guidance via `load_template()` / `load_guidance()`.


### Philosophies

Each agent runs through a configurable philosophical lens, set independently in the sidebar and stored on `AgencyState` as `strategic_philosophy`, `creative_philosophy`, and `cd_philosophy`. All three default to `neutral` (no lens injected).

**Creative philosophies** (shared by the Creative agent and Creative Director):

| Philosophy | Lens |
|-----------|------|
| Bold & Disruptive | Champions risk-taking and convention-breaking |
| Minimal & Refined | Values restraint, elegance, and precision |
| Emotionally Driven | Prioritises genuine human emotion and authenticity |
| Data Led | Demands strategic rationale grounded in evidence |
| Culturally Provocative | Champions cultural participation and relevance |

**Strategic philosophies** (used by the Strategist):

| Philosophy | Lens |
|-----------|------|
| Challenger | Positions the brand against a dominant incumbent or category orthodoxy |
| Human First | Leads from real human behaviour, needs, and tensions |
| Cultural Strategy | Reads cultural currents and gives the brand a role in them |
| Brand World | Builds a coherent brand universe with distinctive codes |
| Commercial Pragmatist | Prioritises clarity, commercial outcomes, and execution realism |

**Provenance and Taste** (Standard 2.0) — two additional prompt-injection categories scoped per creative role (Creative 1, Creative 2, CD). Filesystem-backed under `prompts/provenance/` and `prompts/taste/`, loaded via `load_provenance()` / `load_taste()` in `prompts/loader.py`. Same neutral-skip convention as the philosophies — callers check for `NEUTRAL` before loading. Initial `.txt` presets are placeholder prose to be replaced with real content later:

| Provenance | Lens |
|-----------|------|
| Northern Working Class | Grounded, anti-pretension, craft-over-abstraction instinct |
| Metropolitan Academic | Reads culture through theory; rigour, reference, layered interpretation |
| DIY Subculture | Improvisational, anti-institutional, energy over polish |

| Taste | Lens |
|-------|------|
| Underground / Referential | Deep-crate, reward-close-attention, distrusts work that shouts |
| Avant-Garde | Art-world-adjacent, radical, unresolved |
| Pop Maximalist | Big, loud, joyful, committed, earns its place in the feed |
| Craft Traditionalist | Long-lineage typography, headlines and images with staying power |

### LLM Provider Support

The framework supports provider switching via configuration — change the `LLM_PROVIDER` environment variable to swap between:

- **Anthropic** (Claude) — default
- **Google** (Gemini)
- **OpenAI** (GPT)

---

## Data Model

Core state object: `AgencyState` (Pydantic `BaseModel` in `models/state.py`). This is the single source of truth passed through every graph node.

**Enums**: `WorkflowStatus`, `AgentRole`, `LLMProvider`, `CreativePhilosophy`, `StrategicPhilosophy`, `Provenance`, `Taste` — all `str, Enum` for type safety and serialisation. All four lens enums (philosophies + provenance + taste) include a `NEUTRAL` value that bypasses prompt injection entirely. `Provenance` and `Taste` are Standard 2.0 additions (see ADR 0014); their presets are placeholders at this stage.

**Supporting models**:
- `CDEvaluation` — structured evaluation used by Standard 1.0 (score 0–100 with validation, strengths, weaknesses, direction)
- `AgentOutput` — single agent output with metadata (agent, provider, model, iteration, content, timestamp, optional evaluation)
- `Territory` / `CampaignDeliverable` / `CampaignConcept` — Standard 2.0 creative artifacts (see ADR 0014). `Territory` is the atomic output of Creative 1; `CampaignConcept` is Creative 2's structured campaign (title, core idea, deliverables list, rationale)
- `GraderEvaluation` — Standard 2.0 grader output (score 0–100 + rationale only, no qualitative feedback)
- `CDSynthesis` / `ConceptScoreSummary` — Standard 2.0 final editorial judgement. Schema supports N concepts for the future parallel variant; the current graph passes one

**State design**: Dual access pattern — latest outputs at top level (`creative_brief`, `creative_concept`, `cd_evaluation`) for quick access by downstream agents, plus a full ordered `history: list[AgentOutput]` for traceability and UI display.

**Graph boundary**: LangGraph accepts `AgencyState` on the way in but returns a plain dict on the way out (and `stream()` yields per-node dict updates). Call sites that consume graph output — the Workflow page and the pipeline test — rehydrate with `AgencyState.model_validate(raw)` at the boundary so downstream code uses attribute access and typed nested models (`AgentOutput`, `CDEvaluation`). For streaming, per-node updates are merged into a running dict first and rehydrated once at the end.

**Key fields on AgencyState**:
- `client_brief` — the raw brief supplied by the user
- `strategic_philosophy` (default `neutral`) — shapes the Strategist's lens when writing the creative brief
- `creative_philosophy` (default `neutral`) — shapes the Creative agent's lens when generating ideas
- `cd_philosophy` (default `neutral`) — shapes the Creative Director's evaluation lens
- `llm_provider` (optional override) — when set, agents use this provider instead of the config default. Populated from the sidebar selector on each run.
- `llm_model` (optional override) — when set, agents use this model name instead of `get_model_name(provider)`. Populated from the sidebar selector on each run.
- `approval_threshold` (default `80.0`) — minimum CD score required for approval
- `max_iterations` (default `3`) — hard cap on creative loop iterations
- `iteration` — incremented by the Creative agent on each pass
- `status` — tracks workflow lifecycle via `WorkflowStatus` enum

Standard 2.0 extends the same state object (not a separate class). Additional fields slot into the existing groups (see [ADR 0014](docs/adr/0014-multi-stage-creative-pipeline.md)):
- Input lenses: per-role provenance + taste — `creative1_provenance`, `creative1_taste`, `creative2_provenance`, `creative2_taste`, `cd_provenance`, `cd_taste` (all default `neutral`). The CD pair is shared by CD Feedback and CD Synthesis; the CD Grader is always neutral by contract.
- Agent outputs — `territories`, `num_territories` (default `3`, range `1–10`), `selected_territory`, `territory_rejection_context`, `campaign_concept`, `grader_evaluation`, `cd_feedback_direction`, `cd_synthesis`.
- Run configuration — per-agent temperature: `creative1_temperature`, `creative2_temperature`, `cd_feedback_temperature`, `cd_synthesis_temperature` (default `0.7`) and `grader_temperature` (default `0.0`, hardcoded for repeatable scoring). All bounded `0.0–1.0` to stay inside Anthropic's cap.

Thresholds and max iterations are set per [ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-revised-loop-thresholds.md), which supersedes the original values from [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-iterative-loop-design.md).

---

## Configuration

Application settings are centralised in `config.py` and accessed via helper functions. The `_get_secret()` helper reads from environment variables first, falling back to Streamlit secrets for cloud deployment.

A bridge at module load injects API keys from `st.secrets` into `os.environ` so LangChain providers (which read keys directly from the environment) work on Streamlit Cloud without modification.

Settings include: LLM provider, model name per provider, max iterations, approval threshold, transport retry count, and the public-demo run cap. All overridable via environment variables or Streamlit secrets:

- `LLM_PROVIDER`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `GOOGLE_MODEL`, `OPENAI_MODEL` — provider and per-provider model overrides
- `MAX_ITERATIONS` (default `3`) — hard cap on creative loop iterations
- `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` (default `80.0`) — minimum CD score required for approval
- `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` (default `3`) — attempts made by `wrap_with_transport_retry()` on transient transport errors (see ADR 0012)
- `DEMO_RUN_CAP` (default `10`) — per-session run limit for the public demo (see ADR 0013)

**Default models** (local/development tier), defined in `config.DEFAULT_MODELS`:
- Anthropic: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Google: `gemini-3-flash-preview`
- OpenAI: `gpt-5.4-mini`

The set of models selectable in the sidebar lives in `config.AVAILABLE_MODELS` (one list per provider) — the sidebar imports this dict directly, so config is the single source of truth for both the default and the selectable options.

**Deployment note**: Streamlit Cloud uses per-provider model secrets (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) set in the secrets dashboard for cost control. The sidebar model selector defaults to whatever the config resolves for the active provider.

**Temperature**: `get_llm()` accepts an optional `temperature: float | None` parameter. When `None` (the default) the argument is omitted from the underlying chat-model constructor and each provider's server-side default applies; when set it is passed through to `ChatAnthropic` / `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` / `ChatOpenAI`. Standard 1.0 agents pass `temperature=0.7` explicitly to preserve their prior behaviour. Standard 2.0 agents read per-agent temperature from `AgencyState` (Creative 1, Creative 2, CD Feedback, CD Synthesis — default `0.7`; CD Grader hardcoded to `0.0` for repeatable scoring).

## Coding Conventions

- All agents import LLM via `from agt_sea.llm.provider import get_llm` — never instantiate models directly
- State flows through `AgencyState` — agents read what they need and append to history
- Routing functions are pure (return strings, no state mutation) — state changes happen in dedicated nodes
- Type hints on all function signatures
- Every module and function should have a docstring
- `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of every file
- Enums for fixed vocabularies (providers, roles, statuses, philosophies) — never raw strings
- Config-driven where possible — defaults in code, environment overrides them
- Conventional commits style for commit messages (imperative mood)
- ADRs are append-only — new decisions get new numbered files; older ADRs are superseded rather than edited, with only the `Status:` line updated to flag the supersession
- All new files should follow existing patterns in the codebase

## File Conventions

- API keys: `.env` in project root (gitignored)
- Philosophy prompts: plain text files in `prompts/philosophies/creative/` and `prompts/philosophies/strategic/`, loaded by the convenience wrappers in `prompts/loader.py` (future: RAG-enhanced)
- Provenance and taste prompts (Standard 2.0): plain text files in `prompts/provenance/` and `prompts/taste/`, loaded by `load_provenance()` / `load_taste()` — same neutral-skip convention as the philosophy wrappers
- Prompt templates & guidance: plain text files in `prompts/templates/` and `prompts/guidance/`, loaded by `load_template()` / `load_guidance()` and composed inside agent `_build_system_prompt()` helpers
- Agent system prompts: assembled inline in agent files via `_build_system_prompt()` helpers that compose templates, guidance, and philosophy text
- Sample briefs: `briefs/` directory
- Architecture docs: `docs/architecture.md` (Mermaid)
- Decision records: `docs/adr/` (numbered markdown files + README index)

## Key Design Principles

- Modular architecture — each module is independently developable
- Provider-agnostic AI — switching between Anthropic, Google, OpenAI requires only a config/env change
- Iterative refinement — creative work improves through structured feedback loops with bounded execution
- Separation of routing and state — routing functions decide flow, nodes modify state
- Build incrementally — each phase produces something runnable
- Config over hardcoding — API keys, model names, thresholds, prompts all configurable
- Understand before extending — every file should be readable and explainable
- Clean, readable Python with clear separation of concerns
- Professional, portfolio-grade code and documentation

---

- **ADR 0008** — Multipage frontend architecture
- **ADR 0009** — LLM provider and model override mechanism
- **ADR 0010** — Filesystem-backed prompt injection pattern
- **ADR 0011** — Rehydrate LangGraph output to Pydantic at the boundary
- **ADR 0012** — Error handling and graceful degradation (two-layer retry, `FAILED` contract, `_safe_node` wrapper)
- **ADR 0013** — Demo abuse mitigation via per-session run counter
- **ADR 0014** — Multi-stage creative pipeline with territory selection (Standard 2.0)

4. **Error handling & graceful degradation (retries, failure contract)** ← COMPLETE (Phase 6.1 / ADRs 0012 & 0013)
5. RAG-enhanced creative philosophies
6. Human-in-the-loop approval points
7. Structured logging & tracing (LangSmith)
8. Brand Strategy Module (branding / brand positioning)
9. Provider comparison tooling

## Status

🟢 **Multipage app deployed** — multipage Streamlit frontend with standalone Strategy, Creative, and Workflow modules. Deployed to Streamlit Cloud with auto-deploy on push.

### Roadmap

**Phase 6 — Refinement (current)**
- [ ] Frontend refinement and UX polish
- [x] Error handling and graceful degradation
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop approval points (LangGraph interrupt/resume)
- [ ] Structured logging and tracing (LangSmith)

**Standard 2.0 — Multi-Stage Creative Pipeline ([ADR 0014](docs/adr/0014-multi-stage-creative-pipeline.md))**

Splits creative into a two-stage pipeline with a territory-selection interrupt: Creative 1 generates N territories, the user picks one, Creative 2 develops it into a full campaign, and the Creative Director role fans out into Grader, Feedback, and Synthesis. Provenance and Taste join Philosophy as per-role prompt-injection lenses.

- [x] State model, new enums, new agent conventions (Phase A)
- [ ] Prompt infrastructure, temperature support, sidebar controls (Phase B)
- [ ] Creative 1 agent + standalone Creative page tab (Phases C1 / C-FE)
- [ ] Creative 2, CD Grader, CD Feedback, CD Synthesis agents (Phase C2)
- [ ] v2 graph with territory-selection interrupt (Phase D)
- [ ] Workflow page Standard 2.0 / 1.0 tabs (Phase E)
- [ ] End-to-end testing, architecture diagram, docs sweep (Phase F)

**Future Modules**
- [ ] Tools - a suite of creative tools (page visible with holding message)
- [ ] Marketing - Standalone marketing agent(s) (placeholder page exists)
- [ ] Production - Production services (e.g. Image, Audio, Film, Social content generation) (placeholder page exists)
- [ ] Agnostic - Miscellaneous (placeholder page exists)
