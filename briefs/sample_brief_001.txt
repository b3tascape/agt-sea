We're a mid-sized coffee company called 'Daybreak Coffee' launching a new 
line of cold brew concentrates for the at-home market. 

Our target is millennials and Gen-Z who currently buy iced coffee from cafes 
but are looking to save money without sacrificing quality. 

We need a campaign concept that positions Daybreak as the smarter daily 
ritual — not just cheaper, but a better way to start the day. 

Budget is modest so we're thinking primarily social and digital channels. 
Launch is in 3 months.
