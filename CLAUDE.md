## Code Style

- `from __future__ import annotations` at top of all modules
- Type hints on all function signatures and return types
- Docstrings on all modules and functions
- One function, one job

## Architecture Rules — IMPORTANT

- All agents import LLM via `from agt_sea.llm.provider import get_llm` — never instantiate models directly
- State flows through `AgencyState` (Pydantic) — agents read what they need, update fields, append to `history`
- Routing functions are pure: return strings only, NEVER mutate state
- State changes before END happen in dedicated finalisation nodes, not routing functions
- **Pass-through nodes are allowed** where a conditional edge needs a source node but no state mutation is required (e.g. `check_iterations` in `graph/workflow.py` is `lambda state: state`). The decision itself lives in the routing function attached to the node's conditional edges — this keeps routing pure while giving LangGraph the node it needs to branch from.
- **LangGraph boundary — Pydantic in, Pydantic out (rehydrate at the edge).** `AgencyState` is passed *into* `graph.invoke()` / `graph.stream()` as a Pydantic model. LangGraph returns a plain dict (and `stream()` yields per-node dict updates), so every call site that consumes graph output must rehydrate with `AgencyState.model_validate(raw)` before using it. Downstream code then uses attribute access (`state.status`, `state.history[0].evaluation.score`) — never `.get()` or `state["field"]`. For `stream()`, accumulate the per-node updates into a running dict first (`accumulated.update(node_output)`) and rehydrate once at the end — do not assume the last event contains the full state. See `frontend/pages/workflow.py` and `tests/test_pipeline.py` for the canonical pattern. Inside agent functions (which run *before* the boundary) attribute access already works.
- `config.py` uses `_get_secret()` which checks os.environ first, then st.secrets (for Streamlit Cloud)
- API keys are bridged from st.secrets -> os.environ at module load so LangChain providers can find them
- `get_llm()` accepts optional `provider`, `model`, and `temperature` parameters for frontend sidebar overrides. `temperature` is `float | None` — when `None` (the default) the argument is omitted from the provider chat-model constructor and each provider's server-side default applies; when set it is passed through to `ChatAnthropic` / `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` / `ChatOpenAI`. `temperature` is orthogonal to `with_retry` (temperature is fixed at construction, retry wrapping happens afterwards). Standard 1.0 agents (Strategist / Creative / CD) pass `temperature=0.7` explicitly to preserve their prior behaviour; Standard 2.0 agents read the appropriate per-agent temperature from `AgencyState`.
- Selectable model lists for the sidebar live in `config.AVAILABLE_MODELS` (one list per provider). The sidebar imports from there — do not redefine model lists in `frontend/components/sidebar.py`. Any provider's `DEFAULT_MODELS` entry must appear in its `AVAILABLE_MODELS` list or the sidebar default falls back to index 0.
- Three philosophy fields live on `AgencyState`: `strategic_philosophy` (used by the Strategist), `creative_philosophy` (used by the Creative agent), and `cd_philosophy` (used by the Creative Director). All three default to `NEUTRAL`. The sidebar writes these to `st.session_state.strategic_philosophy`, `st.session_state.creative_philosophy`, and `st.session_state.cd_philosophy`; every page that builds an `AgencyState` must pass all three through.
- **Standard 2.0 data model (ADR 0014)** — the multi-stage pipeline adds supporting models alongside `CDEvaluation` / `AgentOutput` in `models/state.py`: `Territory`, `CampaignDeliverable`, `CampaignConcept`, `GraderEvaluation`, `ConceptScoreSummary`, `CDSynthesis`. Two new prompt-injection enums alongside `CreativePhilosophy` / `StrategicPhilosophy`: `Provenance` (`NEUTRAL` + `NORTHERN_WORKING_CLASS`, `METROPOLITAN_ACADEMIC`, `DIY_SUBCULTURE`) and `Taste` (`NEUTRAL` + `UNDERGROUND_REFERENTIAL`, `AVANT_GARDE`, `POP_MAXIMALIST`, `CRAFT_TRADITIONALIST`). Prompt content for both lives as one `.txt` file per non-NEUTRAL enum value in `prompts/provenance/` and `prompts/taste/`, loaded via `load_provenance()` / `load_taste()` in `prompts/loader.py`. Same neutral-skip convention as the philosophy wrappers: callers check for NEUTRAL and skip the load. The v1 `creative_director.py` and v1 `workflow.py` are untouched; v2 agents and graph live in separate files.
- **Per-role prompt-injection lenses on `AgencyState`** — Standard 2.0 carries one provenance + one taste field *per creative role*: `creative1_provenance`/`creative1_taste`, `creative2_provenance`/`creative2_taste`, and `cd_provenance`/`cd_taste` shared by CD Feedback and CD Synthesis. All default to `NEUTRAL`. The CD Grader is always neutral by contract — never inject philosophy, provenance, or taste into it. Same sidebar-mirrors-state convention as the existing philosophy fields; the provenance/taste fields slot in alongside the philosophies in the `# --- Input ---` block, with a `# [2.0]` marker.
- **Per-agent temperature on `AgencyState`** — temperature lives per agent so values flow through the graph and are recorded for reproducibility: `creative1_temperature`, `creative2_temperature`, `cd_feedback_temperature`, `cd_synthesis_temperature` (all default `0.7`), and `grader_temperature` (default `0.0`, not sidebar-exposed — hardcoded for repeatable scoring). All are bounded `0.0–1.0` (Anthropic's cap). Agents pass the value through to `get_llm(temperature=...)`; the `temperature` parameter lands on `get_llm()` in Phase B. Fields slot into the `# --- Iteration tracking ---` block alongside `max_iterations` / `approval_threshold`.
- **Standard 2.0 agent-output fields on `AgencyState`** — `territories: list[Territory]` + `num_territories: int` (default 3, bounded 1–10) + `selected_territory: Territory | None` + `territory_rejection_context: str | None` for the territory stage; `campaign_concept: CampaignConcept | None`, `grader_evaluation: GraderEvaluation | None`, `cd_feedback_direction: str | None`, `cd_synthesis: CDSynthesis | None` for the campaign stage. All live in the existing `# --- Agent outputs ---` block with a `# [2.0]` marker — not segregated into a separate section. The interrupt node and checkpointer that operationalise these fields land in Phase D.
- **Structured output for list-valued schemas — wrapper model required.** LangChain's `with_structured_output()` rejects bare generic aliases like `list[Territory]` at composition time (`ValueError: callable list[...] is not supported by signature`). Agents that produce a list as their structured output must define a local wrapper model (e.g. `class TerritorySet(BaseModel): territories: list[Territory]` inside `agents/creative1.py`), pass the wrapper to `with_structured_output()`, and unwrap the list before writing to state. These wrappers are implementation details of the agent — keep them module-local, do not add them to `models/state.py`, and do not propagate the wrapper type beyond the agent boundary.
- **Agent input contract is agent-scoped, not caller-scoped.** When an agent reads an optional state field (e.g. `territory_rejection_context`), it reads it regardless of who is calling — graph, standalone page, test, future caller. Fields that are semantically inputs belong in the agent's read-set; do not scope reads to a specific caller.
- **State organisation — don't segregate by workflow version.** `AgencyState` is one object shared by both Standard 1.0 and Standard 2.0. When adding new fields, extend the existing functional groups (`Input`, `LLM overrides`, `Agent outputs`, `Iteration tracking`, `History`, `Workflow`) rather than trailing a "v2" section. A subtle `# [2.0] …` marker inside a group is fine to cluster related fields; a top-level version split is not.
- **Safe-node wrapper** — every agent node is wrapped with `_safe_node()` at graph-build time in `graph/workflow.py`. New agents inherit failure handling by construction — do not add `try`/`except` inside agent functions. The error-string format is owned by `format_node_error(fn_name, exc)` in the same module; standalone pages that call agents directly outside the graph (e.g. `frontend/pages/strategy.py`, `frontend/pages/creative.py`) must import and use it to construct `state.error` so the display contract stays consistent. See ADR 0012.
- **Failure contract** — `WorkflowStatus.FAILED` and `state.error` are the contract between the graph and the frontend. On failure, routing diverts to a `finalise_failed` node → `END`. Frontend pages check `state.status == WorkflowStatus.FAILED` after rehydration and render the `error_state` component instead of agent output. Routing functions begin with a uniform `if state.error is not None: return "failed"` guard — the mutation already happened in `_safe_node`.

## Agent Conventions

- Each agent function signature: `def run_agent(state: AgencyState) -> AgencyState`
- Each agent must: call `get_llm()`, update relevant state fields, append `AgentOutput` to `state.history`
- Each agent resolves provider/model as: `state.llm_provider or get_llm_provider()` and `state.llm_model or get_model_name(provider)` — this is how sidebar overrides reach the agents via `AgencyState.llm_provider` / `AgencyState.llm_model`
- `AgentOutput` must include: `agent`, `provider`, `model` (via `get_model_name()`), `iteration`, `content`, `timestamp`
- Creative Director uses `llm.with_structured_output(CDEvaluation)` for validated scoring
- Creative agent checks `state.cd_evaluation is not None` to determine initial vs revision path
- **Philosophy injection pattern** — Strategist, Creative, and Creative Director each build their system prompt via a module-level `_build_system_prompt(philosophy)` helper (Creative also has `_build_revision_prompt`). Each helper follows the *neutral-skip* rule: when the philosophy is `NEUTRAL`, `philosophy_section` stays empty and the prompt reads as if the feature wasn't there at all; otherwise the text is loaded via the appropriate `load_creative_philosophy` / `load_strategic_philosophy` wrapper and injected into a dedicated section. Strategist and Creative read `state.strategic_philosophy` / `state.creative_philosophy` respectively; the Creative Director reads `state.cd_philosophy` (not `state.creative_philosophy`).
- **Creative 1 (Standard 2.0) — `_build_system_prompt(philosophy, provenance, taste, num_territories)`.** Creative 1 composes three neutral-skip sections (philosophy, provenance, taste) and interpolates `num_territories` into the prompt body so the agent asks for exactly the count `AgencyState.num_territories` requests — never hardcode "three". Reads `state.creative_philosophy`, `state.creative1_provenance`, `state.creative1_taste`. Rejection context (`state.territory_rejection_context`) is steered in the human message rather than the system prompt (per-run context, not a persistent lens) and follows the same neutral-skip rule — when `None`, nothing is injected. Uses `AgentRole.CREATIVE_1` on its `AgentOutput`. The territory-count interpolation pattern generalises: any future agent whose output cardinality is user-configurable should interpolate the count into the prompt body rather than hardcoding it.
- Strategist prompts are assembled from reusable pieces via `load_template()` (structural scaffold) and `load_guidance()` (technique-specific guidance) — don't hardcode the brief template or proposition guidance inline.
- **Logging** — agents use stdlib `logging` for runtime diagnostics. Module-level convention: `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` at the top of the file, `logger.warning()` for recoverable anomalies (e.g. retry paths), `logger.error()` for failures. Introduced in Phase 6.1 alongside the CD validation-retry helper; Phase 6.4 will layer structured logging/tracing on top.
- **Run guard** — every agent-invoking frontend page must call `check_run_allowed()` from `frontend/components/run_guard.py` before constructing `AgencyState` or calling an agent. If it returns `False`, render `render_run_limit_reached()` and `st.stop()`. The check-and-increment is atomic, so callers cannot forget to bump the counter. Cap is `config.DEMO_RUN_CAP` (default 10, env-overridable). See ADR 0013.

## Workflow Rules

- Run tests after making changes to agents or graph logic
- Run `ruff check .` before committing
- Commit messages: imperative mood, conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`)
- ADRs are append-only — new decisions get new numbered files, never edit old ones. The one exception is updating the `Status:` line of an older ADR to flag that it has been superseded or refined (see ADR 0006 → 0007, ADR 0003 → 0011).
- Workplans live at `docs/workplans/` while work is in progress. When a workplan's work is complete and its corresponding ADR is committed, move it to `.archive/workplans/` with `git mv`. Specs follow the same pattern: live specs in `docs/specs/`, completed specs in `.archive/specs/`. The permanent record of decisions lives in `docs/adr/` — workplans and specs are transient scaffolding, ADRs are the durable artefact.
- When adding a new agent, follow the pattern in `agents/strategist.py`
- Explain your reasoning before making changes — what you're doing, why, and what alternatives you considered
- When introducing a new pattern or concept, explain it as if teaching a mid-level developer

## Deployment

- Streamlit Cloud auto-deploys from main branch
- `frontend/app.py` has `sys.path.insert` at top to resolve `agt_sea` imports on Streamlit Cloud
- Page files loaded via `st.Page()` run in the same process, so `sys.path` is already set when they execute
- API keys and config overrides go in Streamlit Cloud secrets dashboard, not .env
- Per-provider model secrets (`ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `GOOGLE_MODEL`, `OPENAI_MODEL`) override defaults on Cloud for cost control
- `.streamlit/config.toml` pins `base = "light"` so the app never falls through to Streamlit's dark theme regardless of user OS preference. All visual styling comes from `b3ta.css`.
- `app.py` initialises session state defaults (philosophies, provider, model, thresholds, `run_count`, and the Standard 2.0 per-role provenance / taste + per-agent temperature fields) via `setdefault` before the sidebar renders, so pages never hit a missing key even if the sidebar fails on first load
- **Sidebar scope** — top-level controls are shared by Standard 1.0 and 2.0 (philosophies, provider, model, max iterations, approval threshold). Standard 2.0-specific controls (per-role provenance + taste selectors for Creative 1 / Creative 2 / CD, and per-agent temperature sliders for Creative 1, Creative 2, CD Feedback, CD Synthesis) live inside a single collapsed `st.sidebar.expander("STANDARD 2.0 CONTROLS")` block. Streamlit does not allow nested expanders, so each role is a markdown sub-heading inside the single expander. CD Grader is not sidebar-exposed: it is neutral and temperature-0 by contract. When a v1-only tab eventually lands, the whole expander can be hidden conditionally without moving the widgets.
- Configurable thresholds live in `config.py` and are read via `_get_secret()`: `MAX_ITERATIONS` (default 3), `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD` (default 80.0), `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` (default 3), and `DEMO_RUN_CAP` (default 10). All four are overridable via env var or Streamlit secret.

## Current Phase & Roadmap

**Current:** MODULE 01) Phase 6 — Refinement (error handling, frontend refinement, human-in-the-loop, logging/tracing)

**Multipage restructure complete** — frontend is a multipage Streamlit app with `st.navigation()`. Shared components live in `frontend/components/`, pages in `frontend/pages/`, theme in `frontend/themes/b3ta.css`.

**Modules planned:**
1. Workflows - Creative Campaign Development (Strategist -> Creative -> CD loop) — COMPLETE, deployed
2. Strategy - Standalone strategist page — COMPLETE (standalone, calls `run_strategist()` directly)
3. Creative - Standalone creative page — COMPLETE (standalone, calls `run_creative()` directly)
4. Tools - a suite of creative tools (Tools page visible with holding message)
5. Marketing - Standalone marketing agent(s) (placeholder page exists, not visible)
6. Production - Production services (e.g. Image, Audio, Film, Social content generation) (placeholder page exists, not visible)
7. Agnostic - Miscellaneous (placeholder page exists, not visible)

## Ignore these directories
- `.archive/` — contains snapshots, backups, completed one-off specs, and completed workplans, not working code. Never read from or execute anything in this directory. Specifically:
  - `.archive/specs/` — completed feature specs (design documents that have been implemented)
  - `.archive/workplans/` — completed execution plans (operational plans whose work is done and whose ADR is committed)
